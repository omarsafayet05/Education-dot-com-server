    "details": "The human mind is complex and mysterious, functioning in ways we are only beginning to understand. At the forefront of this research are psychologists, professionals who examine and unravel the reasoning behind why people think, act, and feel the way they do. Some psychologists delve into the unconscious mind to explore the intricacies of interpersonal relationships; others develop and refine theories to explain the human brain and then use that knowledge to assess and treat a number of disorders. Students can preview this academic field through several online psychology courses, made available for free from some of the best universities.While careers vary, psychologists generally study human thought and behavior by observing, recording, and analyzing how people relate to each other and their environments. Psychologists work in many settings, with some providing mental care, some researching human behavior, and others developing new programs and treatments for pathologies. They can be university professors, therapists, social workers or researchers. A small number of professionals work as industrial-organizational psychologists, helping companies improve employee efficiency and morale. Regardless of which specialization psychologists choose, they aim to better understand thoughts, emotions, feeling, and behavior by exploring patterns, identifying causes, and testing theories via research and treatment."
